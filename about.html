    <p style="margin: 100px; text-align: center; font-family: Georgia; color: #757f83; font-size: 25px;">A full-stack web-developer in training, I have a background in elementary education.  A rapid transition to online learning over the past few years has led to a growing market for apps, sites, and online tools with real educational value. In tune to the needs of the end-user, but without the know-how to create effective resources on my own, my coding journey began.</p>
